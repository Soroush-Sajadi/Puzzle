The author focus is mostly on dragging items from one section and dropping on the 
target on the other section and if items end up on right place the player will win. 
What can be developed further?
1- being able to drag items in different directions.
2- being able to drag item inside of sections they are originaly from.
3- adding save so the game will be saved on reload.
